# Miscellaneous small jQuery plugins and code fragments #
[http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/)

This repository contains a collection of minor jQuery plugins which are too small, too simple, or just not exciting enough to require individual pages. More will be added as I find the time... and the code!

Visit the [project page](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/) for more information and usage examples!
